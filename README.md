# commutable

Immutable notebook document model, operations, and history for Jupyter/IPython.

Relies on [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for the
underlying data structure used for the notebook.

## Inspired by

* [Elm's time traveling debugger](http://debug.elm-lang.org/)
* [Practical Undo](http://www.macwright.org/2015/05/18/practical-undo.html)
* [Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)

## Roadmap

Provide utilities for working with IPython/Jupyter notebooks under their common
operations.
